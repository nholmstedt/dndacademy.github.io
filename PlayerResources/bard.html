    <button class="accordion">Blade Ward</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: Self<br><b>Components</b>: V, S <br><b>Duration</b>: One Round<br></p>
      <p>Tracing an arcane sigil in the air, you grant yourself resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapons until the end of your next turn.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Dancing Lights</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time: </b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: 120 feet<br><b>Components</b>: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)<br><b>Duration</b>: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br></p>
      <p>You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. 
    <br>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range. </p>
    </div>  
        
    <button class="accordion">Friends</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: Self<br><b>Components</b>: S, M (make-up applied to face) <br><b>Duration</b>: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br></p>
      <p>Using your action, choose a creature you can see that isn't hostile toward you. You gain advantage on Charisma checks toward it for the duration. When the spell ends, the creature realizes you used magic on it and becomes hostile, possibly attacking or getting other payback.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Light</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: Touch<br><b>Components</b>:V, M (firefly or glowing moss) <br><b>Duration</b>: One hour<br></p>
      <p>You use your action to touch an object no longer than 10 feet in any dimension, causing it to shine bright light of a color you choose in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If the object is completely covered, the light is blocked. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss the light as an action.<br> 
      <br>If your target is an object held or worn by a hostile creature, the creature must pass a Dexterity save to avoid being lit by the spell.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Mage Hand</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: 30 feet<br><b>Components</b>:V, S <br><b>Duration</b>: One minute<br></p>
      <p>You use your action to create a spectral, floating hand at a point you choose. Once made, you can use your action to control the hand. It can move up to 30 feet at a time, but can't be more than 30 feet away from you or it will vanish. The hand is able to manipulate objects, open an unlocked door or container, put away or get an item out of an open container, or pour out a vial's contents. It can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. You use an action to dismiss the hand before the end of the duration.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Mending</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br><b>Range</b>: Touch<br><b>Components</b>:V, S, M (2 lodestones) <br><b>Duration</b>: Instantaneous<br></p>
      <p>You take a minute to cast this spell, and it fixes a break or tear in an object you touch while leaving no traces of the damage. The damage can't be longer than 1 foot in any dimension. The spell can fix constructs and magic items, but can't restore magical properties.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Message</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: 120 feet<br><b>Components</b>:V, S, M (copper wire) <br><b>Duration</b>: One round<br></p>
      <p>You point at a creature and whisper a message that only it can hear, and it can whisper back a reply that only you hear. You can cast through objects if you know the target and that it's beyond the wall, but magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metals, a thin sheet of lead, and 3 feet of wood will block the spell. The spell can move through corners and other openings</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Minor Illusion</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: 30 feet<br><b>Components</b>:S, M (fleece) <br><b>Duration</b>: One minute<br></p>
      <p>You create a sound or an image of an object that lasts for the duration. The illusion ends early if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.<br>

<br>If you create a sound, it can be any volume and noise. The sound can continue unabated for the duration, or you can make sounds at different times.<br>

<br>If you create an image of an object, it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create any sensory effects. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion.<br>

<br>A creature can use its action to make an Investigation check on the illusion. If it succeeds, the illusion becomes faint to it</p>
    </div>
        
    <button class="accordion">Prestidigitation</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: 10 feet<br><b>Components</b>:V, S<br><b>Duration</b>: Instantaneous<br></p>
      <p>You create one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You create a harmless sensory effect.</li>
  <li>You light or put out a small fire.</li>
  <li>You clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</li>
  <li>You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>You make a small mark appear on an object or surface for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>You create a nonmagical trinket or a hand-sized illusory image. It lasts until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss an effect as an action.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Thunderclap</button>

      <p>Choose a beast that you can see. It must be able to see and hear you. If its Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, it must pass a Wisdom save or be charmed by you. If you or one of your companions harms it, the spell ends.</p>

      <p>A humanoid you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if you are currently fighting it, or it becomes charmed by you until the spell ends or someone in your party harms it. It will know it has been charmed when the spell ends.<br>

      <p>Blue, green, or violet lights outline objects inside a 20-foot cube of space. All creatures in the area make a Dexterity save or be cast in light as well. The light cast by this spell illuminates a 10-foot radius.<br>
      <br>Attacks against affected creatures are made with advantage, and affected creature or object (if applicable) will no longer be invisible.</p>
    </div>
        
    <button class="accordion">Feather Fall</button>

    </div>
                
    <button class="accordion">Heroism</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range</b>: Touch<br><b>Components</b>: V, S <br><b>Duration</b>: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br></p>
      <p>Until the spell ends, a creature you touch is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any remaining temporary hit points.<br>
      <br><b>At Higher Levels:</b> You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.</p>
    </div>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute (Ritual)<br><b>Range</b>: Touch<br><b>Components</b>: V, S, M (100gp pearl, owl feather) <br><b>Duration</b>: Instantaneous<br></p>
      <p>Touch one object through the casting of the spell. If it is a magic object, you learn its properties and how to use them, if it requires attunement, and how many charges it has if any. You learn if any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.<br>
      <br>If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</p>
    </div>
                        
    <button class="accordion">Illusory Script</button>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute (Ritual)<br><b>Range</b>: Touch<br><b>Components</b>: S, M (10gp lead ink; consumed) <br><b>Duration</b>: 10 days<br></p>
      <p>You write on suitable writing material and imbue it with an illusion that lasts for the duration.<br>
      <br>To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.<br>
      <br>If the spell is dispelled, the original script and the illusion disappear.<br>
      <br>A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.</p>

      <p>You create an image that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at an unoccupied spot and lasts for the duration. The image is only visual. If anything passes through it, it's revealed to be an illusion.<br>
      <br>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot in range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.<br>
     <br> A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Investigation check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.</p>

      <p>You inscribe a glyph either upon a surface or within an object that can be closed to hide it. It can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast the spell, it ends without being triggered. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. Once the glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br>
      <br>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics, creature kind, or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph.<br>
      <br>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Investigation check to be found.<br>
      <br>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Explosive Runes:</b> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failure (your choice when you create the glyph), or half damage on a success.</li>
        <li><b>Spell Glyph:</b> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the triggering creature. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile or harmful things, they appear as close as possible to the creature and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>At Higher Levels:</b> The damage of an explosive rune glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</p>

      <br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to make the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter it so that its movements appear natural for the image.<br>
      <br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion. A creature can use its action to determine that it's an illusion with a successful Investigation check.

      <p>A humanoid you see must pass a Wisdom save or be charmed. If you're fighting it, it has advantage.<br>
      <br>While charmed, you have a telepathic link to it if you're on the same plane. You can use this link to issue commands it obeys, no action required. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it completes the order and doesn't receive further orders, it only defends itself.<br>
      <br>You can use your action to take total control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you decide and nothing you don't allow it to. You can also have the creature use a reaction, but this takes your reaction as well.<br>
      <br>If the target takes damage, it makes another Wisdom save. On a success, the spell ends.<br>

      <p>Choose a creature on the same plane of existence known to you. Creatures that don't sleep are immune. You or a willing creature you touch enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, it's aware of its surroundings, but can't take actions or move.<br>
      <br>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in its dreams and can converse with it as long as it remains asleep. The messenger can also shape the dream's environment. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can end the trance or wait for the target to fall asleep.<br>
      <br>You can make the messenger appear terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of up to ten words and the target must make a Wisdom save. On a failure, the target gains no benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.<br>
      <br>If you have a small portion of the target's body, it makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

      <br>When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.<br>
      <br>A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.<br>
      <br>This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.</p>

      <p>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however, open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy Meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.<br>
      <br>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.<br>
      <br>The illusions include audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.<br>
      <br>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.</p>

      <p>You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.<br>
      <br>Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.<br>
      <br>You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a ninecourse banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>

      <p>You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration. When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit. the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.</p>

      <p>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.<br>
      <br>You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.<br>
      <br>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.<br>
      <br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>

      <br>This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.<br>
      <br>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.<br>
