      <p>Some otherworldly being gives you an omen through the use of some divining tool. Asking it about the result of something you intend to do in the next 30 minutes will reveal one of four omens:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>If they will turn out badly, <b>Woe</b>,</li>

        <li>or if nothing particularly good or bad will happen, you will see <b>Nothing</b> at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The otherworldly being isn't capable of accounting for changes in circumstances between now and doing the thing, and if you try to ask again before taking a long rest, there is a 25% chance the reading will be random.</p>

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other, then crashes down.

      <p>Touch a creature dead for no longer than 10 days. If its soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell has no effect on undead.<br>
      <br>This spell neutralizes poisons and cures nonmagical diseases. This spell doesn't remove magical effects. If they aren't removed prior to casting, they return when the creature comes back to life.<br>
      <br>This spell closes all mortal wounds, but doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature doesn't have body parts or organs necessary for survival, the spell fails.<br>
      <br>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attacks, saves, and ability checks. Every time it finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.</p>

    <br>Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you've seen before. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.</p>

      <br>You can mentally command a ghoul as a bonus action if they are within 120 feet of you. You can command multiples at once if you issue the same command.
